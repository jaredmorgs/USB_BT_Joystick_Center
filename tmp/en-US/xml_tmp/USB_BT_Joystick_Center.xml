  <chapter id="Map_Buttons">
    <title>Map buttons</title>
    <para>How you map buttons in &PRODUCT; depends on whether the game or application features support for physical controllers (instead of touch screen controls), or whether the game or application is touchscreen only (on-screen controllers).</para>
    <section id="Physical_Controller_Support">
      <title>Physical Controller Support</title>
      <para>Games that feature physical controller support are almost &quot;plug and play&quot; with &PRODUCT;. All you should need to do is map the physical controller keys on your joystick to the controller map present in the game.</para>
    </section>
    <section id="On-screen_Controller_Support">
      <title>On-screen Controller Support</title>
      <para>Many applications on touchscreen devices use a virtual keyboard or virtual D-pad and buttons to control the game. Some games have no visible buttons, however there are regions on the screen that activate certain game features.</para>
      <para>To use these applications with &PRODUCT;, you need to install a free add-on  called &JOY2TOUCH;. </para>
      <para>The application can be obtained initially by tapping the <guibutton>J&gt;T</guibutton> slider, which prompts you to select an application to open the link with. If you select Google Play, you will be taken directly to the download page for &JOY2TOUCH;.</para>
      <para>For an excellent demonstration of &JOY2TOUCH; working with Farsight Studio&apos;s <citetitle>The Pinball Arcade</citetitle>, refer to this <ulink url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFMRcaSSkuI">Green Robot Gamer YouTube tutorial</ulink>. The Pinball Arcade uses touch screen regions to control flippers and other table-specific controls, and the tutorial is a good example of configuring on-screen controller support for other games.</para>

      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>Why can&apos;t I use the Wii Controller with the Samsung Galaxy S 3 (SGS3), and other new model Samsung handsets. </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para> This is unfortunately a known hardware issue with newer Samsung and HTC devices.</para>
          <para> These devices do not include the full Bluetooth protocol stack, therefore &PRODUCT; is unable to pair the Wii Controller using &quot;pairless&quot; mode (where you do not need to supply the pairing pin).</para>
          <para>The only way to use Bluetooth controllers on these affected handsets is to install a custom ROM, such as CyanogenMod, or choose a controller that is known to work with &PRODUCT;.</para>

        <question>
          <para>What controllers can I use for sure  with the Samsung Galaxy S 3 (SGS3) </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>The  iControlpad and PhoneJoy are working correctly for stock ROM users. You must Bluetooth pair these devices before starting &PRODUCT;. The pairing pin for both controllers is 1234 at time of writing..</para>

        <question>
          <para>I can not get my Samsung device to recognize my USB controller.</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>If you want to use USB devices with your Galaxy Tab or other Samsung devices,  you have to use the OTG Connection Kit. For example, <ulink url="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=usb+adapter+connection+kit+samsung&amp;clk_rvr_id=407743970573"/>.</para>
          <para>Understand that Samsung devices and USB controllers are unreliable because support for USB OTG support varies between ROMs. If in doubt, test the controller using the <ulink url="http://poke64738.iphpbb3.com/forum/26454250nx52440/faqs-usb-bt-joystick-center-f20/download-usb-bt-joystick-center-testapp-t136.html?sid=20dfde5516e26fd4829b4b35f29b0454">USB Test App</ulink>.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I have an original PS3 Sixaxis controller made by Sony, but it can not be found by &PRODUCT;. What do I need to do to make it work?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>You can not use the standard Bluetooth stack in phones and tables with PS3 controllers because of the enhanced data rate they need to send signals. You need to use a USB Bluetooth Cambridge Silicon Radio (CSR) &quot;2.x/EDR+&quot; Dongle so the PS3 controller has the correct Enhanced Data Rate tunnel. An example of such a dongle is <ulink url="http://dx.com/p/ultra-mini-bluetooth-2-1-edr-usb-2-0-dongle-37665"/></para>

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>.THis is caused by the ICP occasionally sending an incorrect first byte in the data stream. To correct the issue, disconnect (unpair) the ICP and reconnect. This issue will hopefully be reduced by iControl code optimization implemented in v6.0 of &PRODUCT;.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I am using Android ICS 4.0.x, and I can not make &PRODUCT; detect any USB Joysticks. How do I solve this?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>.Unfortunately ICS 4.0.1 and earlier does not have USB API support. If your device has USB Host support, but the manufacturer did not include USB &quot;API&quot; support,  you can not use USB Joysticks with the USB/BT Joystick Center. </para>
          <para>Ask the manufacturer for an ICS 4.0.3 update with USB Host API support. Alternatively, try a custom ROM for your device, based on an operating system version higher than 4.0.1. Or use a Wii controller.</para>

          <para>After exiting out of  &PRODUCT;, none of the in-game controls work. How do I troubleshoot this?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Did you exit &PRODUCT; by tapping the <guibutton>Back</guibutton> button on your device? If you tapped the <guibutton>Home</guibutton> button, the &quot;Game Mode&quot; is not activated and the controller mappings will not work.</para>
          <para>Have you correctly mapped the required keys for the emulator or game? If you accidentally mapped incorrect controller scheme to buttons on your controller, the emulator or game will not respond to the button press. Double-check your mapping.</para>
          <para>Did you tap the IME slider and set USBJoyIME as the imput method before starting the game?</para>
