    <title>Map buttons</title>
    <para>How you map buttons in &PRODUCT; depends on whether the game or application features support for physical controllers (instead of touch screen controls), or whether the game or application is touchscreen only (on-screen controllers).</para>
    <section>
      <title>Physical Controller Support</title>
      <para>Games that feature physical controller support are almost &quot;plug and play&quot; with &PRODUCT;.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>On-screen Controller Support</title>
      <para>Many applications on touchscreen devices use a virtual keyboard or virtual D-pad and buttons to control the game. Some games have no visible buttons, however there are regions on the screen that activate certain game features.</para>
      <para>To use these applications with &PRODUCT;, you need to install a free add-on  called &JOY2TOUCH;. </para>
      <para>The application can be obtained initially by tapping the <guibutton>J&gt;T</guibutton> slider, which prompts you to select an application to open the link with. If you select Google Play, you will be taken directly to the download page for &JOY2TOUCH;.</para>

      <title>Samsung Questions</title>
<!--Taken from Bluetooth-Wii problems with newer Samsung/HTC devices FAQ post.-->      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>Why can&apos;t I use the Wii Controller with the Samsung Galaxy S 3 (SGS3), and other new model Samsung handsets. </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para> This is unfortunately a known hardware issue with newer Samsung and HTC devices.</para>
          <para> These devices do not include the full Bluetooth protocol stack, therefore &PRODUCT; is unable to pair the Wii Controller using &quot;pairless&quot; mode (where you do not need to supply the pairing pin).</para>
          <para>The only way to use Bluetooth controllers on these affected handsets is to install a custom ROM, such as CyanogenMod, or choose a controller that is known to work with &PRODUCT;.</para>
        </answer>
      </qandaentry>
      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>What controllers can I use for sure  with the Samsung Galaxy S 3 (SGS3) </para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>The  iControlpad and PhoneJoy are working correctly for stock ROM users. You must Bluetooth pair these devices before starting &PRODUCT;. The pairing pin for both controllers is 1234 at time of writing..</para>
        </answer>
      </qandaentry>
      <qandaentry>
        <question>
          <para>I can not get my Samsung device to recognize my USB controller.</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>If you want to use USB devices with your Galaxy Tab or other Samsung devices,  you have to use the OTG Connection Kit. For example, <ulink url="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=usb+adapter+connection+kit+samsung&amp;clk_rvr_id=407743970573"/>.</para>
          <para>Understand that Samsung devices and USB controllers are unreliable because support for USB OTG support varies between ROMs. If in doubt, test the controller using the <ulink url="http://poke64738.iphpbb3.com/forum/26454250nx52440/faqs-usb-bt-joystick-center-f20/download-usb-bt-joystick-center-testapp-t136.html?sid=20dfde5516e26fd4829b4b35f29b0454">USB Test App</ulink>.</para>

        </question>
        <answer>

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>You can not use the standard Bluetooth stack in phones and tables with PS3 controllers because of the enhanced data rate they need to send signals. You need to use a USB Bluetooth CSR &quot;2.x/EDR+&quot; Dongle so the PS3 controller has the correct Enhanced Data Rate tunnel.

          <para>So I have followed the instructions above to pair the PS3 controller using a Bluetooth dongle, but it doesn&apos;t work.</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Have you tried disconnecting and reconnecting the dongle, and trying to search again?</para>
          <para>If that fails, you may need to hard reset your PS3 controller using a pin or paper clip to press the reset switch. Once you have reset the controller, repeat the pairing process again.</para>

        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>.THis is caused by the ICP occasionally sending an incorrect first byte in the data stream. To correct the issue, disconnect (unpair) the ICP and reconnect. This issue will hopefully be reduced by iControl code optimization implemented in v6.0 of &PRODUCT;.</para>

        <question>
          <para>I am using Android ICS 4.0.x, and I can not make &PRODUCT; detect any USB Joysticks. How do I solve this?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>.Unfortunately ICS 4.0.1 and earlier does not have USB API support. If your device has USB Host support, but the manufacturer did not include USB &quot;API&quot; support,  you can not use USB Joysticks with the USB/BT Joystick Center. </para>
          <para>Ask the manufacturer for an ICS 4.0.3 update with USB Host API support. Alternatively, try a custom ROM for your device, based on an operating system version higher than 4.0.1. Or use a Wii controller.</para>

        <question>
          <para>After exiting out of  &PRODUCT;, none of the in-game controls work. How do I troubleshoot this?</para>
        </question>
        <answer>
          <para>Did you exit &PRODUCT; by tapping the <guibutton>Back</guibutton> button on your device? If you tapped the <guibutton>Home</guibutton> button, the &quot;Game Mode&quot; is not activated and the controller mappings will not work.</para>
          <para>Have you correctly mapped the required keys for the emulator or game? If you accidentally mapped incorrect controller scheme to buttons on your controller, the emulator or game will not respond to the button press. Double-check your mapping.</para>
          <para>Did you tap the IME slider and set USBJoyIME as the imput method before starting the game?</para>
